UtilServer
===========

The non-GWT-client part. It is not in any way "server code", but just normal
Java code, which is not GWT compatible. It is only called "server", because it
is the GWT terminology for "non-client-code". In other words, it contains
mostly a JRE-based implementation of SystemUtils.
